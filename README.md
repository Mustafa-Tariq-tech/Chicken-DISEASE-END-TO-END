üêî Chicken Disease Detection and Management System
Overview
This repository contains a Chicken Disease Detection and Management System that leverages machine learning to identify and predict common chicken diseases based on observable symptoms and environmental factors. The goal of this project is to assist poultry farmers in early detection and effective management of diseases, improving the health of their flocks and minimizing losses.

Features
Disease Prediction Model: Trained model using supervised learning to classify common chicken diseases based on input data.
Symptom Checker: Interface for users to input symptoms and receive disease predictions.
Environment Analysis: Tools for monitoring and managing environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and cleanliness that influence disease risk.
Disease Management Tips: Information and guidelines on how to treat and prevent various chicken diseases.
User-Friendly Dashboard: Simple UI for farmers to interact with the system and check health statuses of their chickens.
Mobile Support: Responsive design for access from mobile devices.
Dataset
The dataset used for training includes:

Symptom Data: Collected from veterinary records and field surveys.
Environmental Data: Historical data on temperature, humidity, coop conditions, etc.
Outbreak Data: Reported cases of chicken diseases in various regions.
Technologies Used
Python: Core language for data processing and machine learning.
TensorFlow/PyTorch: Used for building the disease prediction model.
Flask/Django: Backend framework for API and dashboard functionality.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend for the user interface.
PostgreSQL/MySQL: Database for storing user inputs and disease information.
Docker: Containerization for easy deployment.
